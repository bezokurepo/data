# data
This repo is our data roadmap for languages that require annotating from scratch, or building on existing annotated corpora that is less than 2,000 sentence or the annotation quality is too low. You can view the full list of langauges here - https://github.com/bezokurepo/language-list
# annotation tooling
Visit our website for demos of two open source tools, UDPipe and conllu editor -> https://www.bezoku.tech/landing_data3
# annotation standard
Annotation standards can be found here, following the Universal Dependencies conllu format - https://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html. Typically annotation projects work from silver quality (often some form of automated tokenization) and progress to gold quality, whereby they are used to train bezoku foundation models.
